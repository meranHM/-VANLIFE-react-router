# Vanlife React Router Practice Project 🚐  

This project is a practice exercise from Scrimba's React Router course. It focuses on learning React Router by building a van rental website. Some of the code, including CSS, may be cluttered as the main goal was to understand React Router.  


## 🛠 Tech Stack  
- **React**  
- **React Router 7+**  
- **TypeScript**  
- **Firebase** (for creating a database)  
- **MirageJS** (mocking a database using `server.js`)  


## 🚀 Features  
- Dynamic routing with React Router  
- Nested routes & layout routes  
- Data fetching from Firebase & MirageJS  
- Protected routes (authentication simulation)  


## 📁 Project Structure  
- /src /components /pages /routes /styles /utils /server.js (MirageJS mock API) /firebase-config.ts (Firebase setup)

## 🏗 Setup & Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/meranHM/vanlife-project.git
   cd vanlife-project
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash 
   npm run dev

4. The app should be running at http://localhost:5173 (if using Vite).

## 🔥 Notes
server.js is used to mock a backend API using MirageJS.
Firebase is used for storing and fetching real data.
The CSS file may be cluttered as the focus was on learning React Router.
